                <h3>Ellie</h3>
                <p>
                    Born into a broken world, Ellie grew up faster than most. <br>
                    She's brave, determined, and fueled by pain and love alike. <br>
                    Loss shaped her, but never broke her spirit. <br>
                    Clever and resourceful, she always finds a way to survive. <br>
                    Her loyalty runs deep, even when it leads her down dark paths. <br>
                    Behind her fierce eyes lies a heart still searching for peace.

                <h3>Joel</h3>
                <p>
                    A man haunted by his past, Joel lost everything that mattered. <br>
                    Hardened by years of survival, trust never came easy. <br>
                    Ellie became his second chance, a light in his darkness. <br>
                    He'll protect her at all costs, even if it means crossing lines. <br>
                    His love is quiet, but unshakable. <br>
                    A protector, a fighter, and a man who makes impossible choices.

                <h3>Abby</h3>
                <p>
                    Abby walks a path of vengeance, shaped by trauma and grief. <br>
                    Strong in body and spirit, she won't back down from a fight. <br>
                    Her journey is complicated, filled with moral gray areas. <br>
                    Seen as a villain by some, but a hero in her own eyes. <br>
                    Beneath the armor, there's pain, conflict, and hope. <br>
                    She fights for purpose — even when the world doesn’t understand her.

                  <h3>Tess</h3>
                  <p>
                    Tough, capable and arguably more cutthroat than her smuggling partner Joel, Tess overcame the struggles of the brutal world around her to become a savvy strategist and negotiator. Her leadership and physical prowess made her a respected figure in the Boston QZ. While she subscribed to the dog-eat-dog mentality of a hardened survivor, she remains loyal, courageous and ultimately proves to be selfless in her support of Joel and Ellie's journey.

                    An ardent member of the Fireflies, Marlene has been at the forefront of the struggle to overthrow the military's oppressive rule in the quarantine zones. Despite her experience supporting the rebellion, she remains gentle and compassionate. Her career in medicine cultivated her belief in the value of saving humanity – which she would pursue at any cost.

                    We meet 16-year-old Riley in The Last of Us: Left Behind. Riley is fiercely independent and selfless, but the harsh realities of the world have also forced her to survive by any means possible. Although she is distrustful of new people, she is loving and outgoing around those she trusts, particularly Ellie, her best friend.
